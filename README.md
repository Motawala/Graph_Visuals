- Import and export functionality
- Customizable node and edge styling
- Responsive design for different screen sizes

## Technologies Used

- JointJS for graph visualization
- jQuery for DOM manipulation
- XLSX library for Excel file processing
- HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository
2. Open either `index.html` or `graph_creator.html` in a modern web browser
3. No build process is required as this is a client-side application

## Usage

### Graph Creator (`graph_creator.html`)

The Graph Creator allows you to build custom graphs from scratch:
- Add nodes and edges interactively
- Customize appearance and properties
- Save your work for later use

### Data Visualization (`index.html`)
